# P7-front-end-search-engine
Code repo for project 11 of the Front-end Developer path: a search engine for recipes.

Develop a searching algorithm, with filtering Tags.
The main input value defines the main research, where the algorithm is searching for value in all recipes array.
The found recipes are diplayed on the board.
3 input element Tags, with whom value we filter our pre-selected elements array.
If nothing's found, nothing is displayed.

Creation of 2 different algorithms and benchmark comparison, in order to find the most perfoming one.
Jsbench was used as a performance benchmarck tool.
