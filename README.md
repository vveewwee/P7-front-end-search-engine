Develop a searching algorithm, with filtering Tags.
Tag values are defined by the equivalent array (ingredient,appliance,ustensil) found in the main Recipe Array(data folder).
The main input value defines the main research, where the algorithm is searching the input value in all recipes array and displays the results on the board.
3 input element Tags, with whom value we filter our selected elements array. Results are diplayed on the board.
If nothing's found, alert that nothing is found and nothing is displayed on the board.

Creation of 2 different algorithms in order to find the most perfoming one by performance benchmarking.
Jsbench was used as a performance benchmarking tool.

First algorithm uses the :for: looping, while the second algorithm uses the :forEach(): array method as an optimisation.
